Currenlty WIP, chrome extension to manage reading resources, ideas and suggestions are welcome.

Getting started:
1. Clone the repo and in root do an `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm build-watch` to get the build in `watch` mode.
3. In developer mode in Chrome browser, load the build folder as unpacked extension to see the extension in action.

Current Utility:

1. Context-bookmarking content on pages
